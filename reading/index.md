### The Digital Computer As A Creative Medium by A. M. Noll

Reprinted from IEEE SPECTRUM Vol. 4, No. 10, October 1967 pp. 89-95  
Copyright 1967, and reprinted by permission of the copyright owner PRINTED IN THE U.S.A.  

> In the computer, man has created not just an inanimate tool but an intellectual and active creative partner that, when fully exploited, could be used to produce wholly new art forms and possibly new aesthetic experiences

### There Should Be No Computer Art by Frieder Nake  

Bulletin Of The Computer Arts Society October 1971  

> (…)  
> The discussion centers around the question "is it or is it not art?", and is heated, often extremely ignorant and prejudiced, showing virtually no progress, highly repetitive, although the few interesting new methods and the little knowledge of computers that one needs have been published several years ago. (See e.g. [4] . For a recent survey including a bibliography, see [8] ). I was involved in this development from its beginning on- ward (1964). 1 found the way the art scene reacted to the new creations interesting, pleasing and stupid. 1 stated in 1970 [6] that 1 was no longer going to take part in exhibitions.

### What is generative art? by Margaret A. Boden & Ernest A. Edmonds 

> There are various forms of what's sometimes called generative art, or computer art. This paper distinguishes the major categories and asks whether the appropriate aesthetic criteria—and the locus of creativity—are the same in each case.

## Books 

### 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 by Casey Reas et al.  
Nick Montfort, Patsy Baudoin, John Bell, Ian Bogost, Jeremy Douglass, Mark C. Marino, Michael Mateas, Casey Reas, Mark Sample, and Noah Vawter  

> This book takes a single line of code—the extremely concise BASIC program for the Commodore 64 inscribed in the title—and uses it as a lens through which to consider the phenomenon of creative computing and the way computer programs exist in culture. The authors of this collaboratively written book treat code not as merely functional but as a text—in the case of 10 PRINT, a text that appeared in many different printed sources—that yields a story about its making, its purpose, its assumptions, and more. They consider randomness and regularity in computing and art, the maze in culture, the popular BASIC programming language, and the highly influential Commodore 64 computer.

### When the Machine Made Art: The Troubled History of Computer Art by Grant D. Taylor  

(International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics) Bloomsbury Academic  

> Considering how culturally indispensable digital technology is today, it is ironic that computer-generated art was attacked when it burst onto the scene in the early 1960s. In fact, no other twentieth-century art form has elicited such a negative and hostile response. When the Machine Made Art examines the cultural and critical response to computer art, or what we refer to today as digital art. Tracing the heated debates between art and science, the societal anxiety over nascent computer technology, and the myths and philosophies surrounding digital computation, Taylor is able to identify the destabilizing forces that shape and eventually fragment the computer art movement.
