This project is a first exploration into the generation of algorithms, with the aim to create art. Instead of a machine, these algorithms were meant to be implemented by humans. The initial instructions and further improvement circles are documented in the following. 

## The Assignment

The project was the result of the first assignment of the »Gestalten in Code« course by Fabian Morón Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. The objective was for the students to become acquainted with algorithms in an analog way. 


## Parameters
The concept variables and constants as used in software development was also taught through the assignment by setting them for the created algorithm.

**Variables**  

- Position
- Line Width

**Constants**  

- Number of Points 
- Shapes

## Iteration One

![](./assets/images/1.png)  

>1. Draw 14 points on random positions on the canvas.
>2. Connect these points. The resulting shapes have to become pentagons, squares or triangles. While drawing the lines, hold the pen at the topmost position.
>3. Now trace the lines without taking the pen off. Do this until the pen is empty, the hand wound or you are happy with the resulting shape

The first iteration made it obvious, that the given instructions weren't accurate enough for the desired result. Especially the cohesiveness of the shape was not mentioned and thus nonexistent in most of the drawings.

## Iteration Two

>1. Draw an ellipse in the middle of the canvas, which takes up about 40 percent of the whole area.
>2. Draw 14 points with random positions on the canvas.
>3. Connect the dots with Lines. Try to get an equal mix of pentagons, squares and triangles. The resulting object has to become a closed shape.

This iteration was really close to the desired outcome. However drawing a circle was a hassle for most of the participants.

## Iteration Three

![](./assets/images/3.png)  

>1. Start with a line in the center of the canvas.
>2. Start by extending this line by pentagons, squares and triangles with shared edges.
>3. The resulting form has to be closed, centred and take up about 50% of the canvas area.
>4. Trace edges of the shapes with a connected line. Avoid sharp edges and let the stroke follow the lines imprecisely (e.g by holding the pen at its end)

The final iteration removed the circle in the instructions, which was hard to draw and position in the center. 

## Conclusion

The assignment was a great introduction into creation of algorithms. Even though it seemed really mundane at some point, the iterations helped getting used to the specific instructions needed for a working algorithm later on when implemented with actual code.
