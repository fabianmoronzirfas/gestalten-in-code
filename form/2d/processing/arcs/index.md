summary: The "Law of closure".  > The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.  > [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz)
